### Hackathons Introduction

IoT devices are becoming popular nowadays. The widespread use of IoT yields huge amounts of raw data. This data can be effectively __processed by using machine learning__ to derive many __useful insights__ that can become game changers and affect our lives deeply.
<br>


- This  __#JantaHack challange__ bring you a challenge providing all of you with an opportunity to work with __sensor data__ and solve an interesting __IOT__ problem.

### Problem Statement

You are working with the government to transform your city into a __smart city__. The vision is to convert it into a digital and intelligent city to improve the efficiency of services for the citizens. One of the problems faced by the government is __traffic__. You are a data scientist working to manage the traffic of the city better and to __provide input on infrastructure planning for the future__.

The government wants to implement a __robust traffic system__ for the city by being prepared for __traffic peaks__. They want to understand the __traffic patterns of the four junctions__ of the city.
- Traffic patterns on holidays, as well as on various other occasions during the year, differ from normal working days. This is important to take into account for your forecasting. 

### TASK

### <center><font color='red'>Predict traffic patterns in each of these four junctions for the next 4 months.</font></center>

<br>
- The sensors on each of these junctions were collecting data at different times, hence you will see traffic data from different time periods. To add to the complexity, some of the junctions have provided limited or sparse data requiring thoughtfulness when creating future projections. Depending upon the historical data of 20 months, the government is looking to you to deliver accurate traffic projections for the coming four months. Your algorithm will become the foundation of a larger transformation to make your city smart and intelligent.
